# B1-IsaacSim-Data
Used for saving progress made on the B1 robot simulation in IsaacSim. Simply run IsaacSim and clone repository then commit changes made. The main purpose this serves is to prevent data loss when running IsaacSim inside a temporary pod without having to mess around with any permissions within the namespace.
